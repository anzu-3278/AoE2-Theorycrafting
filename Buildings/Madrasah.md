# Madrasah

## Regional Building

- Replaces the Monastery and the University.
- Cost: 200 wood
- Build time: 60 seconds
- Size: 4x4 tiles
- Garrison space: 10
- Can garrison Monks upon creation and Relics from Monks with Relics.
- Remaining stats identical to University.
- Page 1: Trains Monks and researches Monastery technologies (identical to a Monastery)
- Page 2: Researches University technologies (identical to a University)
- Counts as 2 buildings for the purposes of unlocking Imperial Age.
- While Monasteries being centers of learning is not unique to the Islamic world by any means, the Islamic Golden Age and the House of Wisdom were models of its time and indicative of the degree to which scholasticism was integral to the Islamic religious activity at the time.
- Gameplay wise, this would enable a Castle Age power spike by saving 175 wood and 40 seconds of research time, on top of some building space, if you were planning on building both a Monastery and a University. However, it is more expensive and time consuming for a Monk rush, and depends on you needing the University component at some point for the payoff in tempo that works out to ~35 resources.
- This would be available to the current Saracens and Persians, as well as some, but not all of their potential splits.
