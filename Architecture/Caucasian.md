## Caucasian Architecture Set

### Scope

 - This architecture set would apply to [Georgians](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Georgians)/[Kartvelians](../Civilizations/Kartvelians.md) and [Armenians](../Civilizations/Armenians.md) (but not [Cilicians](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armenians)), as well as some, though not all hypothetical civilizations from the area, such as Circassians (alternatively called Adyghe), Chechens, Ossetians, Alans, Avars, and others.

### Aesthetic

 - I would base this architecture set roughly on existing building sprites from the Eastern European and Mediterranean architecture sets, with different colours. Exceptions to this are:
   - The Monastery which would look like the Central European one (Gelati Monastery) for the Armenians and Georgians and like a Central Asian Mosque or Shrine for most of the others.
   - The Houses, Walls and Towers, which would look Central Asian.
 - All of these sprites would have a different color palette applied to them, with roofs being a darker gray (slightly lighter than the Imperial Age Western European ones) and the bricks being shades of beige that are darker and yellower than the Central Asian buildings but lighter and brighter than the Eastern European ones. I think this color palette would make the architecture the best possible combination of representative and visually distinctive.
