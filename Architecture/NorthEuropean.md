## North European Architecture Set

### Scope

 - This architecture set would apply to [Muscovites](../Civilizations/Muscovites.md) and Novgorodians (but not [Ruthenians](../Civilizations/Ruthenians.md)) and any new Uralic civilizations like the Finns, SÃ¡mi, Vepsians, Mordvins, Permians, Estonians, as well as potentially Vikings or any of their splits.

 ### Aesthetic

 - The aesthetic of this set would focus more on tall slanted roofs with decorations, small windows, with more rounded shapes and a more diverse colour palette than the Eastern European Feudal Age - at least until the Imperial Age, by which time they would start to take on a more Early Modern appearance.
 - Not too dissimilar to the current Viking and Slavs wonders, but *more* so.
 - I have found the example below in [a collection of paintings that are very clearly fantasy](https://nevsepic.com.ua/en/painting/34507-vedic-rus-by-vsevolod-ivanov-35-photos.html), but some of them embody an aesthetic that I think would fit very neatly with the history, as well as being very visually distinctive from other architecture sets.
