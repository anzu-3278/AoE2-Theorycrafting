## Mediterranean Hybrid Architecture Set

### Scope

- This architecture style would be fitting for any civilizations in whose scope Christian and Muslim worlds harmoniously coexisted.
- This includes [Palestinians](../Civilizations/Palestinians.md), [Sicilians](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Sicilians), Andalusians, and possibly some others.

### Aesthetic

 - Buildings would have components of both Mediterranean and Middle Eastern in every sprite, showing how Christians and Muslims had lived side by side.
   - For example, the Town Center would have Mediterranean style pillars and arches, but a Middle-Eastern style roof and awnings.
 - The exception to this would be the Monastery, which, similarly to how there are multiple different House sprites, with one selected at random when placing.
   - Existing ones include the Mediterranean Catholic Monastery (as used by Italians, Spanish and Portuguese), the Mediterranean Orthodox Monastery (as used by Romans, Sicilians and Byzantines) and the Middle Eastern Mosque.
   - A new synagogue sprite should be added to this rotation, as Jewish communities were prominent in both medieval Palestine and Andalusia.
