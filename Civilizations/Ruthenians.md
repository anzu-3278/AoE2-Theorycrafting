# Ruthenians

### An Infantry and Cavalry Civilization

## Goals

 - My goal here was to workshop a realistic split of the current Slavs civilization into multiple East Slavic civilizations. The other civilizations in this split are the [Muscovites](./Muscovites.md) and Novgorodians.
 - My starting idea here was that this would be the civilization representing the early Kyivan Rus, specifically Kyiv and adjacent principalities, and as such would be based around the current Slavs' farming bonus.
 - Additionally, I had the idea for the **Bogatyrs** unique technology while playing the [Mstislav](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Mstislav) scenario. From there, I wanted to try to design a civilization with viable heavy cavalry but no Bloodlines.

## Scope

  - **This civilization is intended to very generally represent the southern East Slavic states that formed in what is now Ukraine.** More specifically, I would specify the inclusion of states that were conquered and ruled by the Mongols and later Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This is specifically to exclude the [Muscovites](Muscovites.md), which freed themselves from the Mongol yoke with little outside influence and are as such a build focused on a much later timeframe.
 - As such, the history that I draw inspiration from will largely be from the Early and Middle Medieval period, starting with the rise of Kyiv 9th century and concluding with the Mongol conquests in the 13th century contemporary with the events depicted in [Mstislav](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Mstislav) and [Kotyan Khan](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Kotyan_Khan).
 - I have not consulted, and am not even aware of any current builds for a Ruthenian, Kyivan or other Ukraininan civilization.

## Name

 - While **Ukrainian** would be a more recognizable name today, it is very anachronistic and only makes sense in the context of the Early Modern political situation in which East Slavic peoples were divided between Muscovy/Russia, Lithuania/Poland-Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate/Ottoman Empire.
 - **Rus** would not work for the same resasons as outlined in [Muscovites](Muscovites.md), namely that it is not specific enough and its modern use is politically charged.
 - **Kievans**/**Kyivans** would fit the naming convention used by the other civs in this split in [Muscovites](./Muscovites.md) and Novgorodians, but I'm not really happy with those two and would rather use a less specific name, one with a more ethnic and less geographic basis. For this reason I also avoid using any of the tribe names from this area, such as the **Polans**, **Volyhnians** and **Drevlians**, all of which are in scope for this civilization.
 - **Ruthenians** intentionally has a more nebulous scope, being used in various times for various things, which is a trait shared (intentionally) by many classic civs like *Teutons*, *Britons*, *Saracens* etc. It has been used for all East Slavs, for East Slavs in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, for East Slavs in the Austro-Hungarian Empires, and for the ancestors of modern day Ukrainians, Belarussians and Rusyns.
   - I am of the opinion that civilizations should have clear in-scope (X should definitely be this civ) but not clear out-scope (it's not a *huge* stretch for Y to be this civ), since that allows them to be used both confidently and flexibly.
   - Examples of civs that do this well are Britons, Mongols, Teutons, Byzantines, Saracens, Hindustanis, Malians, Goths, Tatars, Cumans.
   - Examples of civs that do this badly are Poles, Bohemians, Portuguese, Burgundians, Sicilians, Armenians, Georgians.

## Civilization Bonuses

### Chernozem

#### Effect

 - Farmers work 15% faster.

#### History

 - Ukraine is home to the [Chernozem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernozem) fields, some of the most fertile farmland in the entire world.
 - This is the reason that Ukraine came to be known as the Breadbasket of Europe.

#### Gameplay

 - This is a straight port of the current [Slavs](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Slavs) bonus.

### Zadonschina Raids

#### Effect

 - Barracks technologies affect all Infantry, Stable units and Skirmishers.
 - Barracks technologies effect on Infantry doubled.

#### History

- Early Ruthenian chronicles describe raiding warfare performed by the Ruthenian princes - most notably, [Prince Igor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Igor%27s_Campaign) - on the Ukrainian plains.

#### Gameplay

 - At the time of writing, the techs affected are: [Tracking](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Tracking), [Arson](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Arson), [Squires](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Squires), and [Gambesons](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Gambesons_(Age_of_Empires_II)).
 - All these techs affecting cavalry that does not have access to Bloodlines will provide a unique tradeoff when raiding, while simultaneously making it easier to tech switch to infantry.
 - Infantry that moves faster, has more pierce armor and deals more damage to buildings will also be more effective at raiding in both the mid and late game.
 - This is slightly inspired by the current [Slavs](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Slavs) bonus of getting certain Barracks techs for free. However, I'm taking a different approach here, since timing bonuses are less viable on infantry than archers or cavalry.
 - Yes, this does mean that Ruthenians will have faster infantry than Celts and faster cavalry than Cumans. There are weaknesses in the Siege department to account for this. This is largely an early medieval civilization that still remembers their Viking roots.

### Vladimir's Choice

#### Effect

 - Monks cost -40%.

#### History

 - According to the Primary Chronicle, Grand Prince Vladimir the Great converted to Orthodox Christianity after sending for emmisaries from the four religions present in the region: Catholic Christianity, Orthodox Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
 - The reduction in cost represents the hold over religious matters that the Grand Prince would have had after making that choice, and the religious diversity already present in his realm at that point, including both kinds of Christians, conquered Jewish Khazars, Muslim Bulgars, and Slavic and Finnic pagans.

#### Gameplay

 - This means getting more monks out earlier and being able to keep up with monk techs without disrupting Boyar production, or needing fewer villagers on gold in the mid-game, allowing you to save up stone for a Castle or to make better use of your farming bonus.
 - This is intended to replace the current Slavs' Monk movement speed bonus, which is in my mind not significant past getting free Fervor. Since Monks keeping up with the army is not intended, this version of the bonus instead means to make it easier to make monks on the side to get relics or deal with siege to which infantry armies could be vulnerable.

## Team Bonus

### Four Great Rivers

#### Effect

 - Trade Carts and non-military ships move 10% faster.

#### History

 - The Ruthenians inhabited the old Slavic homeland on the Pontic Steppe, crisscrossed by the four great rivers of the region: the Danube, Dniester, Dnieper and Don, as well as their many tributaries. These rivers were greatly utilized for trade and travel.

#### Gameplay 

 - This is intended to be a slight economic bonus, both for fishing in the early game and trade in the late game. While Ukraine is not heavily associated with fishing in the modern day, significant trade flowed through the Kyivan Rus in its heyday.
 - This bonus affects Trade Carts simply so that it is not completely useless on land maps.
 - Given the dependency the Kyivan Rus had on trade with the Byzantine Empire, it is apt that the effectiveness of this bonus is greatly diminished without an ally.
 - The use of fast dugout canoes by the Rus against the Byzantines to land troops quickly also supports this affecting Transport Ships.

## Unique Techs

### Castle Age: Bogatyrs

#### Stats

 - Cost: 400 food, 400 gold
 - Research Time: 60 seconds

#### Effect

 - [Boyar](../Units/Boyar.md)s and Izgoi regenerate 30 HP per minute.
 - [Boyar](../Units/Boyar.md)s' and Izgoi conversion resistance increased by +4 min, +4 max. (Equivalent to the effect of [Faith](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Faith).)

#### History

 - Bogatyrs are the East Slavic equivalent of medieval equivalent of knights-errant, and appear in Rus' epic poems - bylinas - coming to prominence around the end of the 10th century.
 - The bylinas of the Kyivan Cycle center on the exploits three Bogaryrs - Alyosha Popovich, Dobrynya Nikitich and Ilya Muromets - whose exploits server as inspiration and lesson to Boyars of the time.

#### Gameplay

 - The impact of these legends is reflected in the effect making them similar to Age of Empires 2 heroes - regenerating and harder to convert.
 - The regeneration is also a callback to the [Berserk](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Berserk_(Age_of_Empires_II)), given that many of these nobles would have been descended from Varangian lords and their retinue.

### Imperial Age: Druzhina

#### Stats

 - Cost: 800 food, 400 gold
 - Research Time: 40 seconds

#### Effect

 - [Boyar](../Units/Boyar.md)s and Izgoi improve the attack of Infantry (other than Izgoi) within 5 tiles by 3.
 - [Boyar](../Units/Boyar.md)s and Izgoi with at least 3 Infantry (other than Izgoi) or Skirmishers in a 5 tile radius deal 100% splash damage.

#### History

 - The Druzhina was the personal retinue of a Slavic noble - a Boyar.
 - While most feudal lords had their personal retinues, not just in the East Slavic world but across the Medieval era, I chose to reference this as part of this build because the East Slavic concept of a Druzhina grew out of the personal host of a Viking lord who conquered and settled in eastern Europe.

#### Gameplay

 - I wanted to change [the existing Druzhina tech](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Druzhina) to give a greater focus on combined arms and soldiers fighting alongside their liege lord, rather than something that would only affect infantry. This way, neither unit type benefits without the other.
 - Given its more conditional effect, I reduced the cost slightly from the original iteration of the tech.

## Unique Units

### Izgoi

 - Ruthenian unique infantry unit that is good against fortifications.

#### Stats

 - Cost: 70 food, 20 gold
 - Non-Elite Unit Stats
   - 70 HP
   - 10 melee damage
   - 2 Reload time
   - 2/1 armor
   - 0 [Infantry Armor](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Infantry)
   - 0 [Unique unit armor](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Unique_unit)
   - 0.96 Movement Speed
   - 5 Line of Sight
   - Trained in 24 seconds
   - 4 Bonus damage against [Shock Infantry](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Shock_infantry)
   - 2 Bonus damage against [Standard Building](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Standard_building)
   - 4 Bonus damage against [Stone defence](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Stone_defense)
 - Elite Upgrade Cost: 500 food, 600 gold
 - Elite Upgrade Research Time: 60 seconds
 - Elite Unit Stats
   - 80 HP
   - 13 melee damage
   - 8 Bonus damage against [Shock Infantry](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Shock_infantry)
   - 4 Bonus damage against [Standard Building](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_class:_Standard_building)
   - 7 Line of Sight
   - Trained in 16 seconds

#### Appearance

 - I imagine the sprite looking a bit like the current William Wallace model, with a cape and a broadsword. The Kyivan Rus are known to have used one-sided swords, making area damage a sensible effect for it to have.  
 <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ageofempires/images/5/5f/William_Wallace_DE_views.png" alt="Potential Izgoi appearance" width="550" height="auto" /><br />

#### History

 - Izgoi is a term used in the Kyivan Rus for princes who were excluded from the succession. Due to a unique succession system in the Kyivan Rus, a prince could not inherit a throne not previously held by his father or older brother, and the crown often passed from brother to brother rather than father to son (agnatic seniority). This left a lot of noble sons without any prospect of inheritance. 
 - These disenfranchised princes would then commonly scheme against their uncles and cousins to claim their titles, or any other ones instead, as represented by their bonus against stone defences. Fighting as rebel factions or mercenary groups, they would gather a host around them (a **Druzhina**), and take sides in the many dynastic conflicts and succession crised that plagued the Kyivan Rus.

#### Gameplay

 - This unit will behave largely in the same way as a slightly stronger swordsman. However, the additional food cost would not be entirely justified by the stats - compared to a Champion, they have +10HP, -1 damage, +1 melee armor, +4 bonus damage against stone defences - instead, the additional cost is intended to account for the boost they get after **Bogatyrs** and **Druzhina**.
 - The long training time is there intentionally to make them difficult to mass in Castle Age where they would otherwise be too strong. The intent is to use them like Centurions, to empower the main bulk of your army, since an army of Izgoi would not be as cost effective and would not benefit from **Druzhina**.
 - The advantage of Izgoi over Boyars is that they provide the same boost to your other units more cost effectively and without being weak to Halberdiers. Missing Bloodlines but getting more pierce armor from Gambesons probably pays off for your Boyars against enemy archers, but being able to afford and keep Izgoi alive as gold runs out will prove crucial for your late game potential.

## Tech Tree

### Barracks: Full

#### History

 - The Rus armies of this time were still largely infantry.

#### Gameplay

 - This is a focus of the civilization and accentuates their similarity to Vikings.

### Archery Range:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Hand Cannoneer
 - Missing Parthian Tactics
 
#### History

 - This build is focused on a timeframe before the introduction of gunpowder to Europe.
 - Ruthenian armies frequently made use of Polovtsy (Cuman) mercenaries (as seen in [Mstislav](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Mstislav)).

#### Gameplay

 - Cavalry Archers are viable, but glass cannons, missing both Imperial Age armor upgrades to encourage pairing with another unit type.

### Stable:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Bloodlines.
 - Has access to [Boyar](../Units/Boyar.md) instead of the Knight line.
 
#### History

 - While the Rus of this era did use horses in war, their cavalry was generally of a lower quality to that of their neighboring Cumans, Bulgars and Byzantines.

#### Gameplay

 - This is a fundamental design principle of this civilization - during the period this build is focusing on, the quantity and quality of Ruthenian horses was behind many of their neighbors. They compensated for this with innovative combined arms tactics, as represented by **Zadonschina Raids** and **Druzhina**.

### Siege Workshop:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Siege Ram
 - Missing Siege Onager
 - Missing Bombard Cannon
 
#### History

 - This build is focused on a timeframe before the introduction of gunpowder to Europe.
 - Heavy Siege was not commonly used on the Pontic Steppe as it would have been vulnerable to enemy cavalry raids. Mobility was key.

#### Gameplay

 - A poor siege tech tree is intended to offset the strength of their raiding, particularly the increased impact of Arson.

### Blacksmith:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Ring Archer Armor.

#### Gameplay

 - Largely for balance purposes, since I wanted this civ to have access to Bracer and Thumb Ring, but for their Archer-line and Cavalry Archers to be more like glass cannons than true value plays.

### Monastery:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Atonement.
 
#### History

 - The Christianization of the Rus was a long and complicated process and many rulers remained pagans even after their predecessors converted. There is evidence of syncretism and coexistence between Slavic paganism and Christianity into the late 10th century.
 - While the Kyivan Rus is associated as a center of Christianity, the conversion process was slow and there were people of many cultures and faiths present. Lists of Kyivan diplomats in treaties with the Byzantines list many Finnish and Norse names in addition to Slavic ones, and makes note that some swear to the Christian god and some to their native pagan gods.

#### Gameplay

 - Monks are intended to be a strength of the civilization.
 - For gameplay reasons, lacking both Bloodlines and Atonement leaves one slighlty vulnerable to Monks. **Bogatyrs** offsets this for Boyars specifically, but means that Monks can be used to counter siege without being counterable back. This incentivizes the use infantry and Boyars and raiding rather than, for example, Mangonels.

### Castle: Full

### Market: Full

### University:

#### Availability

 - Missing Bombard Tower
 - Missing Siege Engineers
 
#### History

 - This build is focused on a timeframe before the introduction of gunpowder to Europe.

#### Gameplay

 - A poor siege tech tree is intended to offset the strength of their raiding, particularly the increased impact of Arson.

### Dock:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Cannon Galleon line
 - Missing Galleon
 
#### History

 - This build is focused on a timeframe before the introduction of gunpowder to Europe.
 - Ruthenian navies were largely raiding or mercantile rather than fleets in being, which I feel like the Galleon represents most.

#### Gameplay

 - I would emphasize the use of the Fast Fire Ship to underscore their relationship with the Byzantines, and transports to emphasize the history of raiding.

### Mill: Full

### Lumber Camp:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Two-Man Saw

### Mining Camp:

#### Availability 

 - Missing Gold Shaft Mining

## Architecture: Eastern European

### Castle Skin:

- [Golden Gate of Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate,_Kyiv)
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Golden_Gate_Kiev_2018_G1.jpg/1920px-Golden_Gate_Kiev_2018_G1.jpg" alt="Golden Gate of Kyiv" width="550" height="auto" /><br />
- It was built in the 11th century, right in the middle of the scope of this build.
- One of the original gates of the city constructed by Yaroslav the Wise, constructed in imitation of the Golden Gate of Constantinople, it is the most prominent and unique fortification of the Kyivan Rus.
- The only knock against it could be that it might look too much like a Wonder with the cupola and cross on top, so maybe some artistic liberty could be taken to tone those down in the Castle sprite.

### Wonder Skin:
- [Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia_Cathedral,_Kyiv)
- <img src="https://www.worldhistory.org/uploads/images/14795.jpg" alt="Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv" width="550" height="auto" /><br />
- It's the most recognizable landmark in Kyiv and one of the grandest cathedrals in the region.
- It was built in the 11th century, right in the middle of the scope of this build.
- It is basically guaranteed to feature in any reasonable Ruthenian campaign.

### Monk: Orthodox

## Language: [Old East Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_East_Slavic)

 - This is the language that would have been in use during most of the existence of the Kyivan Rus, and would emphasize that this build is based on an Early Medieval time period.

## Sigil

 - The current [Slavs](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Slavs) Sigil is based on the sigil of Yaroslav the Wise, which is now used as the coat of arms of Ukraine, and is as such entirely appropriate for this build to inherit it in the split.  
 ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ageofempires/images/4/41/Slavs_AoE2.png)

## Jingle

 - While anachronistic, I think something based on the [Great Gate of Kiev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itdm46ZVLfA) theme from Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition", performed in a medieval arrangement, would be an interesting easter egg.
 - Alternatively, if the above proved too modern sounding, [Меч Арея (Живосил Лютий)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJWcaAjc5CE) 0:00-0:50 has the vibe that I'm looking for.

## Campaign: The Rurikids

 - This will be the first arc of the Grand Campaign in the DLC that introduces this Slavs split, focusing on the origin story of the Russian Empire.
 - The Prologue scenario, played as the Vikings before this, will focus on the legendary figure of [Rurik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurik) and his host and the events of [the Calling of the Varangians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_of_the_Varangians), concluding with the raid of Constantinople in 907 by Oleg the Seer (known as Helgi in the Varangian world), and will play in a similar manner to [Honfoglalas](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Honfoglal%C3%A1s_(Definitive_Edition)) or [Ragnar](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnar).
 - The campaign will focus on the first rulers of the Kyivan Rus and the highlights of their reigns:
   - **Igor the Old**
     - His sieges of Constantinople
     - Raids in the Caspian Sea
     - His death at the hands of the Drevlians and their subsequent subjugation by his widow Olga
   - **Sviatoslav I**
     - The conquest of Khazaria
     - The invasion of Bulgaria in the Balkans
     - Fighting against the Volga Bulgars and Alans
   - **Vladimir the Great**
     - The dynastic struggle against his brother Yaropolk
     - The war with the Poles over the Cherven towns
     - The subjugation of the Yotvingians
     - Suppressing rebellions from northern East Slavic tribes
     - Fighting the Volga Bulgars
     - The conquest of Black Sea ports from the Byzantines
     - His ultimate conversion to Christianity
   - **Yaroslav the Wise**
     - His struggles against his father
     - His struggle for the throne against his half-brother Sviatopolk who was supported by Boleslaw the Brave of Poland
     - His struggles against the Swedes in Estonia
     - The recapture of the Cherven towns from Poland
     - Wars with the Pechenegs and Byzantines
     - Possibly an expedition into Georgia alongside Swedish forces
     - The Cumans penetrating into Kyivan territory past the fortifications that his father and he had constructed
     - The granting of freedoms to the Novgorod Veche, laying the groundwork for the Novgorod Republic's independence and the second arc of this Grand Campaign
- The time of these rulers covers roughly the first 150 years of the Kyivan Rus, goes as far back as history can confidently assert, and follows the establishment and rise of the Rus' state.
- By the end of this period, the Rurikid dynasty had fractured between the sons of Yaroslav the Wise, and the infighting that will become characteristic of the Kyivan state has become commonplace and the state has become significantly more decentralized.
- This is, in effect, a story about raiders and conquerors becoming squabbling feudal lords. While the Kyivan Rus state would not fall for another two centuries until the Mongols arrive, the groundwork for their destruction has already been laid.
- This campaign would feature appearances from all three East Slavic civilizations, as well as basically all existing civilizations from the region:
  - Byzantines
  - Bulgarians
  - Poles
  - Vikings (as Swedes)
  - Lithuanians (as Yotvingians)
  - Cumans
  - Tatars (as Pechenegs)
  - Georgians
  - Persians (as possible enemies during the Caspian Sea raids)
  - Goths (Crimean Goths could be a side faction when conquering Byzantine ports on the Black Sea)
  - Magyars (as allies in Sviatoslav's Invasion of Bulgaria, possibly elsewhere)
  - Huns (as Alans)
- This would make this arc of the campaign the most civilization-diverse campaign in the game, at 15 civilizations.
- There is also potential for many as yet not implemented civilizations, such as Finns (and various different Uralic peoples), Khazars, a dedicated civilization for Pechenegs, and potentially some north Caucasian peoples like Circassians.
- The third and final act will have you playing as the [Muscovites](./Muscovites.md) and is outlined in that build.

## Game Plan

 - The early game will feel very similar to the current Slavs with the farming bonus. Fishing will be slightly boosted, but probably not enough to change anything in the early game.
 - The Militia and Man-at-Arms play will be slower to get out compared to before since Arson is no longer free, but will be more potent due to the increased effect on infantry. Adding in Scouts or Skirmishers early to counter enemy Archers will also now not hamper your ability to pressure buildings. With Men-at-Arms now having +6 against standard buildings instead of +4, it might be worth it to get your enemy housed or waste their resources by forcing them to rebuild resource camps if other avenues of pressure prove inaccessible.
 - The strong food economy will make it easier to boom, especially on closed maps, though the lackluster siege options might make fast Castle or fast Imperial strategies less appealing even with cheaper Monks available.
 - Due to the limited Siege and Gunpowder options, Ruthenians might instead consider staying in Feudal and slinging an ally with their incredible farming bonus.
 - In Castle Age, Long Swordsman play might be viable since they will by that time move faster than Celtic swordsmen and have 5 pierce armor. Supplementing with Skirmishers with 7 pierce armor and doing double damage to buildings, you have a very cheap army, allowing you to boom while putting pressure on the enemy.
 - Alternatively, you can play it defensively, with Izgoi, Skirmishers and Monks covering each others' weaknesses.
 - By Imperial Age, you will want to have a Castle up since your main siege option will be the Trebuchet. Your power composition will still be Champions and Arbalesters or Skirmishers, supported by Monks and Izgoi or Boyars.
 - As gold runs out, Izgoi will be your ticket to countering enemy trash, but you will want to support them with Halberdiers or Skirmishers just to keep the effects of **Druzhina** up as much as possible. For this reason, keeping Castles standing will be of paramount importance - Champions will not have the same impact in the super late game.
 - In team games, Ruthenians will be able to play both flank and pocket. Flanks will be able to use their strong Men-at-Arms rush and good Skirmishers to keep the enemy at bay. In pocket positions the booming Ruthenian farm economy will be able to support allies until the heavy cavalry arrives. While Ruthenian Boyars are not as good as generic Knights in melee until you get **Bogatyrs**, and possibly not after, they are comparable against ranged enemies after Gambesons and can choose fights after Squires, and in the late game they end up roughly comparable to Sicilian Cavaliers with Hauberk.
 - Ruthenians can be played as a raiding civilization similarly to Sicilians, Vikings, Bulgarians or Armenians. Your economy bonus is one of the strongest in the game, but you lack real power units and your military is not very population efficient, and this will likely not be offset by the population efficiency of your farmers. Doing damage is key, which is why Arson applies to such a wide variety of units.
 - Ruthenians may run into issues on water-heavy maps due to lacking basically any bonuses for getting on water quickly, and lacking siege warships in the late game. Transporting will be your main option but with faster moving Transport Ships, Infantry, Cavalry and Skirmishers, you should be able to sneak landings and at least hold your own that way.
 - On hybrid maps, Ruthenians should only have a slight edge over a generic civilization with the Fishing Ship movement speed bonus, and will probably struggle against most civilizations with more concrete bonuses.
 - Ruthenians have all the defensive options except Bombard Tower, so they should be decent on Regicide. King of the Hill will probably not be favorable to them though, since they rely on mobility and damage rather than powerful tanky units.

## Summary

 - The Ruthenians are a civilization that can pull off both a strong rush and a strong boom, but must do one of those well to gain an advantage over the enemy. Chase two rabbits and you will catch neither.
 - In this they are similar to their neighbors the Cumans, who can also choose to go for a second Town Center in Feudal Age and play it greedy or to use their cheaper Archery Ranges and Stables to put pressure on their opponent.
 - The army composition of fast moving infantry and archers supported by an economy bonus is also similar to the gameplay of Vikings (who have historically greatly influenced the region) and Celts (whose design is a 90s pop culture mishmash that does not bear taking seriously).
 - Their mid to late game is evocative of the Byzantines (another historically accurate pairing, *funny how that happens*), who also lack Bloodlines and significant power units, but are able to hold their own on the defensive with good Monks and counter units.
 - Their strengths are in slipping through inadequate defences to cause havoc and being a nuisance while avoiding direct fighting. Their best matchups will be civilizations that have poor mobility or defences, such as 
 - The Ruthenians' weaknesses lie in situations where they are unable to force engagements, such as against more mobile enemy like the Mongols, Cumans, Tatars (*cough*) and in situations where they are straight up facing more powerful units, such as fully upgraded Paladins, gunpowder, Siege Onagers (Muscovites, Mongols, Cumans).
 - Their weakness to Siege Onagers fits with [The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Destruction_of_Ryazan) where a Bogatyr by the name of [Evpaty Kolovrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evpaty_Kolovrat) is killed by a Mongol stone launcher.
 - Their reliance on infantry also exposes a weakness to Cataphracts, which is fitting since the better organized Byzantine army tended to win out in prolonged conflicts against Rus raiders.

## Considerations of changes to other Civilizations or the common Tech Tree

### [Fortified Tower](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Fortified_Tower)

 - Given that this build has a relatively early focus, fortifications are very significant. In particular, fortifications controlled travel along the rivers of the region, and river control is mentioned in several treaties with the Byzantines. I think if Fortified Towers ever made their way into the game the Ruthenians should have some kind of incentive to use them.

### Plunder

 - The Kyivan Rus, much like their Viking kin, spent most of the early Middle Ages raiding their neighbors for plunder, rather than conquering outright. From their Caspian expeditions to their *many* wars against the Byzantines, raiding was a large part of early Kyivan miltiary tradition. Age of Empires 2 doesn't really have any raiding mechanics other than getting resources upon destroying something, like in the Viking Unique Tech [Chieftains](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Chieftains). I wonder if a similar effect could be translated into a regional or common technology which the Ruthenians would also have access to.

### Infantry Repairing Siege and Ships

 - I have often made the argument that there is a large unexplored design space in military units being able to repair siege or ships. This would be a natural extension of the playstyle of certain civilizations like Ruthenians, Vikings, Sicilians etc, which were known for far flung expeditions where maintaining supply lines and baggage trains was not viable.
 - I see two main ways to explore this:
   - A military unit, probably infantry, which also has the ability to repair siege and/or ships. In the current game, the [Serjeant](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Serjeant) would be a natural fit given they already have the ability to build.
   - A technology available to some civs, which would allow some or all military units, again most likely just infantry, to repair siege and ships. This would significantly improve the viability of infantry, though it could be oppressive in late game infantry and siege combos.

### Dismantling ships

 - During the [Rus-Byzantine War of 907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine_War_(907)), Oleg of Novgorod had moved his ships onto land and transformed them into vehicles. I was considering a **regional technology** available to **Ruthenians**, **Novgorodians**, **Vikings**, and potentially a few other civilizations, which would **allow their ships to "dismantle" when near land**, for example a Galleon would turn into a Ram and a Scorpion, or a Cannon Galleon (if the civilization had access to it, of course) would turn into a Ram and a Bombard Cannon. While this would definitely be exploitable from a resource standpoint, given ships are much cheaper than equivalent land units, I think there is a way to make this work, such as:
   - Having the new siege units spawn damaged, to represent that they are unfinished.
   - Having a resource cost associated with the dismantling.
   - Requiring a villager to come and build the siege units once the ship has been dismantled. In effect, a ship would create a 1x1 or 2x2 build site, and a villager would build that, creating siege units when finished.

## Tabled Ideas

### [Izgoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izgoi)

 - A more *avant-garde* idea than what I went for could be that an Izgoi could try to convert a sufficiently damaged Castle, being "removed" if they succeed, representing that a landless noble has become landed by claiming and conquering a holding and usurping a title. Conversion mechanics are random in Age of Empires 2, and converting a Castle is too much of a power swing to leave to chance in my opinion.

### [Voyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyi)

 - The Kyivan Rus, like most feudal states, had two kinds of military. The Druzhina was a standing force, a personal retinue of a feudal lord. The Voyi was a force drafted from the local population, led by a Voivode who is appointed by the prince.
 - While the difference between Druzhina and Voyi is fairly evident in Age of Empires 2 with regards to whether a unit costs gold, a dedicated position of levy leader could justify a unique unit, perhaps with an aura effect benefitting trash units, similarly to a [Centurion](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Centurion_(Age_of_Empires_II)). I might choose to save that idea for Vlachs though, since Voivode was also used as the term for a sovereign in that area.

 ### [Kholop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kholop)

 - Kholopy were a class of slaves in Medieval East Slavic society. I was able to find references to Kholopy serving in the military, but not in what capacity. If it ends up being something interesting I might include it, but I would not include a generic idea of slave soldiers to just one civilization.

### [Veche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veche)

 - The Veche was a popular assembly in Medieval Slavic culture. Originating from tribal assemblies, as late as the 16th century free men of a Slavic city or community would meet to discuss matters of state, usually electing a leader, but also laws and war. It bears some resemblance to other states' lower chambers of parliament. For example, Grand Prince Iziaslav was briefly [ousted by the Kyivan Veche in 1068](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_uprising_of_1068). If this doesn't end up becoming a regional, I would probably save this for Novgorodians since Novgorod was a republic and had the most notable and powerful veches.
 - Since one notably duty of the Veche was to raise the militia, one idea for an effect that I had was for it to be a prequel to [Conscription](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Conscription_(Age_of_Empires_II)) that you could do in Castle Age.

## Loose Threads

 - The unique unit was a bit of a reach I think. I was unable to find any unique land military unit or unique fighting style - the Kyivan military at the time was largely influenced by the Vikings and Byzantines and was otherwise quite generic for the time. While there were second sons and bastards all over the world, I think the Kyivan unique succession system justifies the unit just barely, even if it is basically just a swordsman that is affected by some unique technologies.
 - I worry that this civilization will end up focusing on Infantry too much, and thus end up being too weak overall. Missing both Bloodlines and Ring Archer Armor might make those other unit lines unviable even with the other bonuses, and with mediocre siege options as well, this civilization might end up underpowered.
