# Armenians

### A Cavalry and Defensive civilization

## Goals

 - My approach here was to start from a  specific mechanical element and design a historically cohesive and balanced playstyle around it, that being the bonus of having Heresy and Faith instantly researched for free when reaching the appropriate ages.
 - This bonus, along with having access to the fully upgraded Knight line, even if it was otherwise generic, would, in my mind, make any civilization decent at Knight play.
 - With this in mind, the Armenians should be a specialist civilization, with notable strengths and a straightforward game plan and goal of ending the game early with strong Knights coming out of a base and economy that is difficult to raid and disrupt, mirroring their history.
 - This build was originally written and published in October 2023, mere days before the announcement of The Mountain Royals DLC which introduced Armenians to the official game.
 - Unlike the official Armenians civilization, this was primarily based on Bagratid Armenia, with only minor design elements like the Imperial Age UT based on the migration to Cilicia.
 - I did not choose to split the civilization into Bagratid Armenians and Cilician Armenians since they would not have considered each other different peoples, and their military strategies show an evolution rather than a divergence.
   - If I did choose to split the civilization, I would keep the civilization representing the Bagratid era as Armenians, using it as a geographic term, and call the other civilization Cilicians.
 - I have ended up consulting a few other builds but I didn’t really like any of them so all ideas here are my own.

## Civilization Bonuses

### Apostolic Church

#### Effect

 - Atonement, Devotion, Faith and Heresy free.
 - Researched instantly upon reaching the relevant age, Monastery is not required.

#### History

 - Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as the state religion as well as one of the first places where it was significantly adopted by the populace, and it has remained independent and defiant despite centuries of dominance by Muslim powers.

 #### Gameplay

 - This will be the Armenians’ primary military bonus and means that Monks will be significantly less effective as counterplay to any strategy. This increased flexibility can be combined with fully upgraded Knights and Cavalry Archers to an advantage in Castle Age.

### Legacy of Urartu

#### Effect

 - Advancing to the Feudal Age costs 200 food and 200 wood.

#### History

 - The Armenian heartland and people hold continuity with a great power from antiquity. Many institutions, innovations, a written language and other cultural elements are already established in Armenia by the start of the AoE2 relevant timeframe.

#### Gameplay

 - This is 100 total resources fewer than regular and also less intense on the food economy which is crucial in the early game, allowing either for a super-fast Feudal Age up-time or for increased eco flexibility once you advance, as well as making it easy to delay farms until Horse Collar and bank on those wood savings in the midgame.

### Tradition of Horsemanship

#### Effect

 - Stable and Blacksmith Armor techs cost 25% less and research in 33% less time.
 - Does not affect unit upgrades at the Stable, only general techs (Bloodlines and Husbandry).

#### History

 - Since antiquity, Armenian cavalry was considered to be of very high quality and their well bred horses were the envy of the region.
 - Armenia was rich in iron and its soldiers were notably well armored, especially cavalry.

#### Gameplay

 - This is intended to be the Armenians’ secondary military bonus. This will make it significantly easier to get critical upgrades and stay ahead of the tech curve compared to your opponent. This will be necessary as the game plan is very clear and the enemy will be expecting it.

### Fortified Heartland

#### Effect

 - Town Centers, Houses, Monasteries, Towers and Walls built in 25% less time.

#### History

 - The Bagratuni Armenian capital and heartland were constructed and fortified after the dynasty managed to secure independence from the Caliphate. The city of Ani was known as the “city of forty gates” and the “city of a thousand and one churches”.

#### Gameplay

 - This is the Armenians’ primary defensive bonus and will make holding out under pressure or relocating your base easier, echoing how the Armenian capital moved multiple times through their medieval history and how they managed to survive as a civilization no matter how many times they were conquered.
 - It was my intention to balance a historical justification with how the game is actually currently played, as well as make a bonus that helps defensively but would be difficult to use for douching.
 - While conceptually similar to the [Spanish](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Spanish_(Age_of_Empires_II)#Civilization_bonuses) bonus, Armenians do have access to Treadmill Crane, meaning that it is really more similar to the [old Korean](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Koreans#The_Forgotten) bonus for faster built fortifications, with regard to its place in the broader civ design.

## Team Bonus

### Great Armenian Highway

#### Effect

 - Coinage and Banking free one age early.

#### History

 - During the Bagratid era, Armenia lay on an important trade route between the Caliphate, the Byzantine Empire, and the Kievan Rus.
 - Armenia has also consistently throughout its history been used as a frontier march by the empires that exerted influence on it. As such, it has frequently provided aid to, or been provided aid by its allies, both militarily and economically.

 #### Gameplay

 - This bonus will facilitate help between teammates, whether it is slinging or helping an ally recover from an attack, much in the way that Armenia did throughout its history.
 - This is a rare team bonus that really only has an effect in team games, and is also probably the most net resources a team bonus gives advantage across the entire team. I feel this is balanced by the fact that slinging is fairly rare in team games, and even when it does happen, it is usually only from one or two players, so not all of the resources saved are doing work. Instead, this bonus is intended to give the team more options - similar to the Saracens' Market bonus.

## Unique Techs

### Castle Age: Lamellar Armor

#### Stats

 - Tech Cost: 200 food, 200 wood
 - Research time: 90 seconds

#### Effect

 - Imperial Age Armor upgrades become available in Castle Age.
 - Upon reaching the Imperial Age, they are researched immediately if not already.

#### History

 - Armenian soldiers were noted to have used lamellar armor as early as the 8th century, and for being well armored in general. Armenia’s substantial iron deposits would have allowed advancements in armor to be made much sooner.

#### Gameplay

 - This will allow the Armenian player to gain the upper hand in a prolonged Castle Age game against civilizations with more permanent military bonuses, but is not a permanent military bonus in itself and is an investment that should be carefully weighed against the cost of actually going to the Imperial Age.
 - The Armenians have significant tempo bonuses, and I felt that giving them a quality bonus on top of that would be oppressive, especially since they are a bit of a one-trick pony, similarly to the Huns.
 - As it provides no permanent bonus, it is largely intended as a tradeoff of a small amount of resources and Castle work time in Castle Age, hedging on the game staying in Castle Age for long enough for the advantage to kick in.
 - In Castle Age, the pressure on Castle work time is significantly lower since Trebuchets are not available, and the Castle can only produce Petards, which are situational, and the **Nizakanetord**, which is a counter unit and also somewhat situational. Hence, the cost of the tech in resources is low, but its research time is long.
 - If possible in the current engine, the tech would be auto-researched once Imperial Age is reached, where it would have no effect.

### Imperial Age: Cilician Fortifications 

#### Stats

 - Tech Cost: 1400 food, 250 stone
 - Research time: 90 seconds

#### Effect

 - Instantly researches Town Watch, Town Patrol, Hoardings and all University techs except Chemistry.
 - The effects of Architecture and Treadmill Crane are doubled.
 - Castles cost 10% less stone, have 1 more range and line of sight, and +3 attack.

#### History

 - In Cilicia, the Armenians came into contact with Byzantine and Crusader fortification designs, and this knowledge exchange is represented with them getting all defensive technologies instantly.
 - Permanent effects of this tech are meant to echo the civilization bonuses of the Byzantines (who were obviously in direct contact with the Armenians in Cilicia), the Sicilians (who are the closest we currently have to a civilization representing the Crusader States) and the Franks and Teutons (the majority of Crusaders were French and German).
 - Both Armenia and Cilicia were heavily fortified and this will encourage a Castle-heavy playstyle and make the Armenian players’ economies easier to defend, especially in chokepoints and mountains, mirroring their history.

#### Gameplay

 - While this is giving a huge discount in both resources and research time on the techs that are instantly granted, I felt like the stone cost balanced this. 
 - Since the technologies granted are almost all defensive, getting them all at the same time isn’t really a power spike except when Castle dropping, and even then, the effects beyond generic are limited, and one would need to make 4 Castles after researching this just to break even on stone.
 - Instead, this is intended to be a catch-up mechanic (or, situationally, an “oh, shit” button) that would buy you time to mount a defense or relocate, mirroring the circumstances that led to the foundation of Cilician Armenia.
 - Chemistry is still necessary before Bombard Towers can be built, but if this is researched, they can be built immediately after Chemistry is researched.
 - Since Armenians get Bracer, their Castles would max out at 18 damage per arrow, which would be incredibly effective against many units whose pierce armor typically lets them handle Castle fire, like Paladins, Tarkans, Huskarls.

## Unique Units

#### History

 - Use of javelins in cavalry in cavalry battles is attested in the Armenian epic David of Sassoun.
 - The unit’s name is literally just “javelin thrower” in Armenian - I am open to suggestions for a better one. Just “Mounted Javelineer” maybe?

#### Gameplay

 - Given that Armenians lack Camels and have below average Halberdiers, this unit is intended to provide an alternative to monks for dealing with mass cavalry. They are a decent Cavalry Archer variant, with slightly higher HP and attack, but lower Rate of Fire and a minimum range. 
 - They are intended to be used against masses of cavalry where the effectiveness of Cavalry Archers and Monks would be limited. Since Armenians miss Hand Cannoneer, this unit can also be a decent counter to mass swordsmen because of the Bonus damage and Blast radius (similar to a Ghulam).
 - The blast damage and high attack also makes them similar to Arambai, which also have something akin to an area attack when in larger groups.
- They have the movement speed to hit and run against generic Knights (barely), but their attack delay will make this difficult in most situations and they are intended to be a mobile support unit rather than the bulk of an army.

## Tech Tree

### Barracks:

#### Availability

 - Missing Champion
 - Missing Halberdier

#### History

 - Armenia fielded large armies of infantry, so they get Supplies, but it is not something they should be relying upon for quality.

#### Gameplay

 - Missing Champion is a design aspect they share with the Persians, under whose influence they have been for much of their history - although the current Persians take it a step further.

### Archery Range

#### Availability

 - Missing Arbalester
 - Missing Hand Cannoneer

#### History

 - Armenians heavily utilized mounted archers in their armies, so their Cavalry Archer line is fully upgraded and should be their main ranged support unit.
 - Armenia was late to adopt gunpowder.

#### Gameplay

 - Their crossbow play is generic, but doesn’t really go anywhere in the late game.
 - The **Nizakanetord** is a decent counter to infantry with its bonus damage and area damage, and as such acts as somewhat of a replacement for the Hand Cannoneer.

### Stable: Full

#### Gameplay

 - The Armenians’ primary military focus will be their cavalry, and both the light cavalry and heavy cavalry lines are fully upgraded.
 - Armenians are primarily a Knight into Paladin civilization, with strong tempo bonuses to offset the narrow tech tree.

### Siege Workshop

 - Missing Siege Ram
 - Missing Siege Onager
 - Missing Bombard Cannon
 - Armenians’ era of conquest lay mainly before the AoE2 relevant timeframe. Their Castle Age is generic and in the late game they should instead use their cavalry to raid and their strong Castles and Bombard Towers to slowly push their enemy back in the late game. They have Siege Engineers so their Trebuchets are decent.

### Blacksmith: Full

 - Armenian soldiers were noted as being well armored.

### Monastery: Full

 - While the Armenians get multiple techs in the Monastery for free, these are largely defensive techs and their Monks will primarily benefit from tempo bonuses provided by their cavalry, on top of having all options.
 - If the Monk + Knight combo in Castle Age proves too powerful, I would consider removing Redemption.

### Castle: Full

 - Self explanatory - in the late game, the Armenians’ Castles are their power.

### Market: Full

 - Armenia was an important trade crossroads for much of its history.

### University: Full

 - Defenses are a strength of the Armenian civilization. They can get all these techs except Chemistry at a large discount with their Imperial Age Unique Tech.

### Dock

 - Missing Dry Dock
 - Missing Elite Cannon Galleon
 - Missing Demolition Ship
 - Armenians may have trouble starting out on the water due to the higher demand for wood in the Dark Age. 
 - In the mid-game they are generic and in the late game they may struggle to force engagements but will not find themselves lacking otherwise.

### Mill: Full

 - Armenians should be able to maintain a decent economy when backed into a corner, and having all the economic upgrades available to them is important for this.

### Lumber Camp: Full

### Mining Camp: Full

## Architecture: [Caucasian](../Architecture/Caucasian.md)

### Castle Skin

 - I did not provide one in the original build, and the one from the official civilization is entirely appropriate.

### Wonder Skin

 - I did not provide one in the original build, and the one from the official civilization is entirely appropriate.

## Language

 - I did not provide one in the original build, and the one from the official civilization is entirely appropriate.

## AI Player Names

  - I did not provide any in the original build, and the ones from the official civilization are entirely appropriate.

## Sigil

 - I did not provide one in the original build, and the one from the official civilization is entirely appropriate.

## Jingle

 - I did not provide one in the original build.
 - I'm not a fan of the current one - it sounds very generically Middle Eastern.

## Campaign

 - I did not provide one in the original build.
 - Given that this build focuses on Bagratid Armenia, I would prefer a different one to [Thoros](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Thoros_II).

## Game Plan

 - Armenians will have a strong Feudal Age on account of the cheaper advance, and are flexible when going for any strategy due to the cheaper armor upgrades, though Scouts are particularly strong since Bloodlines is also cheaper and comes in faster.
 - There is no kind of long-term economy bonus, so aggression is necessary. Naturally, this will mean struggling on closed maps, though Armenians are in a good position to contest Relics on Arena. 
 - The closest thing to a booming bonus that Armenians get is that Houses, Walls, and TCs come up faster, meaning less villager time is used up on this. In early Castle Age, with 4 villagers building, you are theoretically getting your first Villagers from your secondary TCs ~15 seconds faster.
 - While you could go for an unexpected Archer or Infantry opening in Feudal Age, these generally fall behind going straight into Knights, which have fewer counters and are better out of the gate.
 - Alternatively, Towers are built in less time, and this also affects repair speed, which also makes repairing comparatively cheaper. On particularly small maps, this might make all the difference in a tower war against a civilization that doesn't have a better bonus (Byzantines, Teutons, Koreans, Incas...)
 - As Armenians, it is in your interest that the enemy doesn't advance to the Imperial Age, since in Castle Age you have a distinct technology advantage. Knights with 2+3/2+4 armor, Faith and Heresy are notoriously difficult to defeat except for strong Camel civilizations, which is where the **Nizakanetord** steps in.
 - In the late game, Armenians should be pushing and raiding with their very strong Castles and fully upgraded Paladins. Hussar is also a very viable option, and all economic upgrades are available.
 - Once gold runs low, you may begin to struggle on account of missing Halberdier and Champion, and you should really make the enemy pay dearly for every Castle you put up. Don't forget that you have fully upgraded generic Cavalry Archers and Herbal Medicine.
 - Armenians play on tempo, and playing greedy is likely to pay off less than playing aggressively. You spend less time walling up at any stage of the game, so the enemy will be more likely to play greedy rather than risk wasting a rush, which is where your Scouts with discounted upgrades come in.
 - Armenians are best suited to open maps, since they spend less time walling than other civilizations, and are primed for scout openings.
 - Strong Castles, Cavalry Archers and the **Nizakanetord** might make Armenians particularly good on Regicide.
 - With a very strong option for Knights in Castle Age and the **Great Armenian Highway** team bonus, Armenians are a very good pick for pocket player in Team Games.

## Summary

 - Armenians feel like a civ with a lot of potential that needs to be capitalized on before they fall behind. Being ahead of the tech curve will help you damage your opponent early and hard.
 - Armenians are similar to raiding civilizations like Huns, Magyars and Tatars, with little in the way of eco bonuses and a streamlined game plan of cavalry and cavalry archers. However, unlike those civilizations, they also avoid traditional counters in a similar manner to the Byzantines and Italians, and like Byzantines they also have a powerful way to deal with both Infantry and Camels, and have an easier time defending against rushes. Similarly to Franks, they focus on a power unit that is difficult to stop even if you know it's coming. 
 - Armenians are most powerful in situations where the map is open and you can choose where and when to engage. While not weak defensively, their early defensive advantages really just mean losing less, and they should at all times be up in the enemy's business.
 - Armenians will likely struggle most against good Camel civs like Hindustanis and Gurjaras, or good economy civs, like Hindustanis, Mayans and Cumans, which can outproduce you to the point that your advantage is significantly dampened or outright subsumed.
 - Against similarly designed civilizations like Huns, Magyars, Cumans and Tatars, they have the defensive advantage, whereas against Byzantines or Franks they may struggle to compete with strong defences and economy bonuses.

## Loose Threads

 - Is the attack bonus for Castles from **Cilician Fortifications** too strong? As it stands, it kills a Paladin in 17 arrows, compared to a generic Castle's 23, an Huskarl in 9 arrows instead of 14, and an Elite Tarkan in 17 arrows instead of 25 - while behaving the same against Rams, Siege Elephants, Siege Towers and unpacked Trebuchets.  
 The range bonus is also relevant, since Bombard Cannons without Siege Engineers will not be able to outrange Armenian Castles. This leaves just Trebuchets and Rams/Siege Elephants.
 - While the civ is intended to have one early-mid game strength and one late game strength, with very little else (a one-trick pony), I worry that these are maybe a bit too strong even by themselves. Monks and high pierce armor units are just not viable plays against Armenians at basically any point, and potentially having +3/+4 armor on any unit in Castle Age is comparable to the Roman bonus which only affects infantry, though that doesn't require a Castle and 90 seconds of research.
